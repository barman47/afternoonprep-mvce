## Project Setup

In the project directory, you can run to get started:

`yarn` - Installs client dependencies.

`cd functions`<br />
`npm install` - Installs server dependencies

Start the app with `npm run dev`

### Alternatively, you can run the following scripts independently to start both client and server.

Run `yarn start` - to start the client http://localhost:3000

Run `cd functions && npm run server` - to start the server http://localhost:5001
